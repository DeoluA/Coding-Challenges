# Second attempt

Afterwards, I tried to clean up the garbage, debugging and fixing what could be done.
The more I tried, the more I realised: _garbage can't be fixed._ 

Back to the drawing board!

# First attempt

I did pretty much garbage, lol.

But what I _intended_ to do was try to find some way to iterate over the array and multiply each pollution by half, then keep checking to see if the sum was more than intended target yet.

...but like I said, it was garbage.
