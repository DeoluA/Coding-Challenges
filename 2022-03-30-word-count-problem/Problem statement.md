I had an interview, where I got posed this problem:

> Write a function that receives a string of words, and truncates the string to at most a length `K`

> The function must *only* return whole words, and can not end with spaces.

> For example, if the input was `"Fishing is seen by some to be a relaxing sport"`, and the given `K` is `15` it should return `"Fishing is seen"`
> However, if `K` is 14, it should return `"Fishing is"`.

> It also shouldn't contain double spaces.
